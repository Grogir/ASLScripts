# LiveSplit.Oracles
These are [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) scripts for Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on emulator.

**Supported emulators:**
- BGB 1.5.1
- BGB 1.5.2
- BGB 1.5.3
- gambatte r571
- gambatte-speedrun r600

Other versions of the above emulators may work, but are untested. Other emulators (such as BizHawk) are currently unsupported and will not work.

## Features
- Automatically start the timer when you select a file
- Automatically reset the timer when you hard reset the emulator (disabled for Ages and Linked)
- Automatically split for certain events (chosen in the settings)

## Installation
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Enter the name of the game in "Game Name"
    - This must be entered correctly for LiveSplit to know which script to load
- Click the "Activate" button to download and enable the autosplitter script
    - If you ever want to stop using the autosplitter altogether, just click "Deactivate"

## Set-up
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Click "Settings" to configure the autosplitter

Here you can enable/disable the options for auto start, auto reset, and auto splitting. If auto splitting is enabled, then you can select the events for which you want the autosplitter to split below under "Advanced".
