# LiveSplit.FEZ
This is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) script for **FEZ** (v1.12) on PC. Supports both Steam and standalone versions.

**Note:** This script requires use of FEZ's speedrun mode (add "--gotta-gomez-fast" to the game's launch options).

## Features
- Syncs IGT with the in-game timer (compare against "Game Time" in LiveSplit)
- Automatically start the timer when selecting "SPEEDRUN" from the file select screen
- Automatically restart the timer when selecting "RESET RUN" from the main menu
- Automatically split for selected events
    - This script currently only has splits for the Any% route.

## Installation
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Enter the name of the game in "Game Name"
    - This must be entered correctly for LiveSplit to know which script to load
- Click the "Activate" button to download and enable the autosplitter script
    - If you ever want to stop using the autosplitter altogether, just click "Deactivate"

## Set-up
- Go to "Edit Splits..." in LiveSplit
- Click "Settings" to configure the autosplitter

Here you can enable/disable the options for auto start, auto reset, and auto splitting. If auto splitting is enabled, then you can select the events for which you want the autosplitter to split below under "Advanced".
